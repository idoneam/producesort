## Dependencies

Use `python3 -m pip install --user -r req.txt` to install the necessary dependencies.

## Getting started

Download the repo and unzip. Load your images into the `img` directory. Use `python3 Main.py` and select the fruit image for analysis. For demonstration purposes, the application will display the input image, the edge mask, the input image with its background subtracted, and blemishes on the input image found by the blob detection algorithm.
