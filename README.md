# producesort

A tool for determining if clementines are rotten based on image recognition.

## Dependencies

Use `python3 -m pip install --user -r req.txt` to install the necessary dependencies.

## Getting started

Download the repo and unzip. Load your images into the `img` directory. Use `python3 Main.py` and select the fruit image for analysis. For demonstration purposes, the application will display the edge mask, the image with its background subtracted, and blemishes found by the blob detection algorithm.
